# Notes about how to write and add a new test file.

This B+ Tree library becomes a submodule of DB-Playground(https://github.com/TakamichiOsumi/DB-Playground).

So, if there are any executables left after 'make clean' and it's not listed in the .gitignore,
executing 'git status' in the top directory of DB-Playground shows 'untracked contents'.

This is annoying and can be avoided by two sets of routines.

1. Remove all of the executables by make clean.

Don't miss updating Makefile of this project.

2. Specify the rules to cover all of the executables in .gitignore.

All of the executables generated by test files are ignored by the description 'tests/*_bptree' in .gitignore at present.
Make a new name of executable consistent with this name rule or update the rule whenever it's needed.
