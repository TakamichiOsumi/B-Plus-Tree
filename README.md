# B+ Tree (Variant)

Making a submodule for my other repository.

# How to build and test

```
% git clone https://github.com/TakamichiOsumi/B-Plus-Tree.git
% cd B-Plus-Tree
% git submodule init
% git submodule update
% make
% make test
```

## Notes

This is a work in progress and written for self-education.

The difference from the normal B+ Tree is that nodes at the same depth are connected as doubly linked list.
